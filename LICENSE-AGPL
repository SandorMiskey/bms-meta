                    GNU AFFERO GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                       Version 3, 19 November 2007

 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/>
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                            Preamble

 The GNU Affero General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
 software and other kinds of works, specifically designed to ensure
 cooperation with the community in the case of network server software.

 The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to
 take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast, our
 General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share
 and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
 software for all its users.

 When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.
 Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the
 freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if you
 wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you
 can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs, and that
 you know you can do these things.

 Developers that use our General Public Licenses protect your rights with
 two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this
 License giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.

 For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains
 that there is no warranty for this free software. For both users' and
 authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as
 changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to
 authors of previous versions.

 The GNU Affero General Public License also permits developers and
 companies to use the AGPL under certain conditions. The AGPL is designed
 specifically to ensure that, in such cases, the modified source code
 becomes available to the community. It requires the operator of a network
 server to provide the source code of the modified version running there
 to the users of that server. Therefore, public use of a modified version,
 on a publicly accessible server, gives the public access to the source
 code of the modified version.

 An older license, called the Affero General Public License and published
 by Affero, was designed to accomplish similar goals. This is a different
 license, not a variant of the Affero GPL, but Affero has released a new
 version of the Affero GPL which permits relicensing under this license.

 The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
 modification follow.

                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS

   0. Definitions.

   "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License.

   "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
   works, such as semiconductor masks.

   "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License.
   Each licensee is addressed as "you".

   "Licensees" and "recipients" may be individuals or organizations.

   "Corresponding Source" means all the source code needed to generate,
   install, and (for an executable work) run the object code and to modify
   the work, including scripts to control those activities. However, it does
   not include the work's System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or
   generally available free programs which are used unmodified in performing
   those activities but are not part of the work. For example, Corresponding
   Source includes interface definition files associated with source files
   for the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically
   linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,
   such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those
   subprograms and other parts of the work.

   The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users
   can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding
   Source.

   The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that
   same work.

   The Corresponding Source for a work in object code form is all the
   source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work)
   run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to control
   those activities. However, it does not include the work's System Libraries,
   or general-purpose tools or generally available free programs which are
   used unmodified in performing those activities but are not part of the
   work.

   The Corresponding Source for a work conveyed by object code is
   the Corresponding Source for the work.

   1. Source Code.

   The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work
   for making modifications to it. "Object code" means any non-source
   form of a work.

   A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official
   standard defined by a recognized standards body or, in the case of
   interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that
   is widely used among developers working in that language.

   The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other
   than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of
   packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major Component,
   and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that Major Component,
   or to implement a Standard Interface for which an implementation is
   available to the public in source code form. A "Major Component", in this
   context, means a major essential component (kernel, window system, and so
   on) of the specific operating system (if any) on which the executable work
   runs, or a compiler used to produce the work, or an object code interpreter
   used to run it.

   The "Corresponding Source" for a work in source code form is the work
   itself.

   2. Basic Permissions.

   All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
   copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
   conditions are met. This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
   permission to run the unmodified Program. The output from running a
   covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
   content, constitutes a covered work. This License acknowledges your
   rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.

   You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey,
   without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains intact.
   You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose of having
   them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you with
   facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with the
   terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do not
   control copyright. Those thus making or running the works for you must
   do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and control, on
   terms that prohibit them from making any copies of your copyrighted
   material outside their relationship with you.

   Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the
   conditions stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 makes
   it unnecessary.

   3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.

   No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
   measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article
   11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or
   similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such
   measures.

   When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
   circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention
   is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to
   the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or
   modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's
   users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of
   technological measures.

   4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.

   You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
   receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
   appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
   keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
   non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;
   keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all
   recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.

   You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,
   and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.
